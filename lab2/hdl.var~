# By uncommenting the following line (definition of 
# NCSIMOPTS - system-wide variable), the simulator will 
# follow the license checkout order as defined by the 
# arguments to the -uselicense option. The order presented
# here as an example will make the simulator prefer AMSD 
# license strings over Incisive license strings for 
# designs with analog content.
